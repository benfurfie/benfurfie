### G'day 👋

My name is Ben. I'm an Australian marketing-focused web developer living in the UK, currently working as Head of Technology at an education-focused company. I specialise in working with [Statamic](https://statamic.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine), and Vue.
